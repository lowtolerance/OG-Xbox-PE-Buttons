# OG Xbox Power and Eject Buttons

These are 3D printable models of the front panel power and eject button assembly for the original
Xbox.

There are three variations -- one with the normal button arrangement, one with the power and eject buttons in reverse order, and one with no icons embossed into the buttons (the idea being that one could emboss them with custom icons).
