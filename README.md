# OG-Xbox-PE-Buttons
This is just a 3D printable replacement power and eject button assembly that I threw together in Fusion 360 for the original Xbox. It's modeled from scratch, using a mesh obtained from a high-res scan as a reference.

I recommend printing this with a high infill setting, pressing this onto the posts takes quite a bit of force, and that plastic bit that bridges the two sides is pretty thin.

Feel free to use and modify, attribution is not necessary ;)
